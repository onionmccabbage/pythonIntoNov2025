Monday
> Welcome and intros
> where to write code: module (just a file) or immediate python
- architecture, structure, and professional code best practice
> maths operators and data types
> indentation
> immutable strings
> lists and tuples (and memory efficiency)
> identifiers
> boolean True and False
> print() and input()
> validate input (remember - all input is string)
> type and type conversion
> the if statement for conditional logic
> for, while, break, continue and pass
> print formatting
> after lunch review exercise
> dictionaries, set
> import, libraries and modules
> functions and defaults
> packages (simply a folder containing python files)

Tuesday
> quick review of where we got to
> if __name__ == '__main__'
- range, generators <<< see completed solution
- comprehensions
> to add libraries to python:
  - python -m ensurepip
  - python –m pip install requests (or any other library you need)
  or 
  - pip3 install requests
    to see what libraries are already installed: pip list
> using requests (to access web API via HTTP)
> strings with triple quotes
> exception handling (try-except etc.)
> scope
- debug tools   
> review exercise
- File input and output
- the nature of file access objects

Wednesday
- quick review of where we got to
- in Python EVERTHING is an Object - every function, every class every module....
- any input or output is necessarily slow: I/O bound
- functions live in classes, which live in modules which live in packages
- custom generator and yield
- global and local scope 
- data modelling structures: 
    use built in structures until they do not suit the purpose (then use classes)
- Objects and Classes (OOP)
  classes have properties (something belonging to the class) and methods (something the class can do)
- get/set as property decorators @property
- name mangling (__) and __slots__ (a bit like private)
- properties, methods
- review exercise
